Phew! Some thoughts:

- These are getting time consuming for me to do in Haskell! We'll see how long
  I can keep up doing this every other day :)
- I'm very glad that Part 2 was exactly what I expected it to be, so my
  approach (writing a function to create a tail path from an existing head
  path) worked well. In Haskell, I didn't have much choice, but in Python I
  wonder if I would've done this all as loop state variables instead of
  functional style (therefore needing a lot of work for part 2).
- I had to stumble around a bit getting my solution to be performant enough.
  Ironically, my first attempt (getTailPath1 in Extras.hs) was too slow
  because I was trying to write more performant code (but failed) by using `:`
  instead of `++`. When I wrote simpler code using `++`, it was sufficient,
  even if not fast.
