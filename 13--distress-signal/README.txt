That was a (fun) ordeal!

I know Haskell's a good language for writing parsers, but it's not an area
that I've explored that much (in any language). (Gotta go back and learn the
Haskell tricks here at some point!) So it ended up being quite a lot of work
for me: I had to figure out how to write a parser in Python first and then
port it to Haskell. (See python directory)
