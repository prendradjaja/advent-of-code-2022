That was fun! A bit "Ugh I'd be done already if I'd been doing this in
Python," but also quite fun in the mind-bendy way, and satisfying to be done
with! I quite enjoyed both the parsing and stack-rearranging parts.

Nice to practice writing a function like `applyN`. Nice to learn that
`transpose` is in the standard library, though it'll be good practice to try
implementing that one myself.

Next time I should definitely look up how to read a file instead of putting
everything in `interact`.
